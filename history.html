	<h1>History</h1>

	<p>Theories differ as to the origin of the name of the falls. According to Iroquoian scholar Bruce Trigger, Niagara is derived from the name given to a branch of the local native Neutral Confederacy, who are described as the Niagagarega people on several late-17th-century French maps of the area.[35] According to George R. Stewart, it comes from the name of an Iroquois town called Onguiaahra, meaning "point of land cut in two".[36] In 1847, an Iroquois interpreter stated that the name came from Jaonniaka-re, meaning "noisy point or portage."</p>
