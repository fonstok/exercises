			<h2>A Few Terms</h2>
			<p><strong>Don't skip the terms!</strong></p>
			<h3>Server</h3>
			<p>Servers simply put, are computers. They have hard drives, files, folders, ram, processors just like the
				computers you use. They are specially built/meant for "serving" content like websites, streaming movies, and
				data. Unlike your computer, they are on 24/7/365 and have a dedicated and specific address so we, the users of
				the internet, can find and access the content stored on them. FYI, you can make any computer into a server.</p>
			<p class="insight">So, there should be no mystery here. You are connecting to a computer, and copying files to it,
				just like a plugging in a portable USB drive and copying files from it to your desktop.</p>
			<h3>FTP</h3>
			<p>FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol. If you take a sec. and analyse the words, it's purpose should
				make some sense. Essentially, computer scientists long ago wrote the rules and process, aka the protocol, for
				files to be transferred over the internet.</p>
			<p class="note">A pet peeve of many in the cool club is to refer to an FTP software's name, as the process of FTP.
				For instance, "I could not CyberDuck my files to the server!" CyberDuck is an FTP software, and the pet peeve is
				more than just me being a nit-picky grub slugger. I'm a teacher, and I need to know that you know that you could
				transfer your files a 1000 different ways and associating the process with one piece of software implies that
				your blinders may be on and you don't know that and likely will not progress to newer better ways of
				transferring your files. There are many paid and free application/plugins that enable FTP so keep that in mind
				or you'll risk peeving the cool club's member's pets.</p>
			<h3>Cache</h3>
			<p>Cache (pronounced cash) is a technical process utilized by internet browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge) to
				temporarily save files on users computers after they download them for viewing from a server. They do this to
				speed up browsing by decreasing the amount of data they have to download. For example, you likely access the
				Amazon, Twitter, Canvas, or Maryville websites' up to 20 times a day. It's also unlikely that many elements like
				the logo, interface, etc. that make up the sites will change very often. So, to save time and effort, browsers
				store image and other files on a folder on your computer so it doesn't needlessly have to download those files
				20 times a day.</p>
			<p class="insight">I'm telling you about cache because a key issue when updating a file is seeing the old "cashed"
				version of the file you uploaded previously instead of the new file you just uploaded - thus driving you batty.
				You will be taught how to turn the cache off or load without the cached files.</p>
