		<p>Welcome to my first structured website!</p>
		<p>Building structure into a website helps define content areas and establish hierarchy. Most websites are structured with a navigation, main section, and a footer.</p>
		<p>This structure has become common practice and breaking this structure format is risky. Website users have learned to know where the navigation is and where they should look for the most important information (usually at the top and in the main section). When we break this structure, we can cause confusion and frustration.</p>
